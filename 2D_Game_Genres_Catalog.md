# Comprehensive Catalog of 2D Game Genres

**Introduction:**  
2D game genres encompass a wide range of gameplay styles and mechanics, all viewed in two-dimensional space (typically side-scrolling or top-down). Below is a comprehensive catalog of 2D game genres and notable subgenres, each defined by its core gameplay dynamics and stylistic variations. For each genre, we outline the defining mechanics and provide example games (when relevant) to illustrate the style. This catalog is intended as an idea bank for game development and creativity, focusing on how each genre plays rather than its historical context.

## Action-Adventure Games  
Action-adventure games blend the physical excitement of action games with the exploration and puzzle-solving of adventure games. Players typically control a character through an open-ended environment, engaging in combat while also overcoming obstacles or puzzles to progress. Hallmarks of the genre include **exploration of interconnected areas**, **real-time combat**, and **item-based progression** (e.g. finding tools or keys to unlock new zones).

_Example:_ **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**, **Hyper Light Drifter**.

## Beat ’Em Up Games  
Beat ’em up games (brawlers) pit heroes against waves of enemies in melee combat. Players move through levels and defeat foes using punches, kicks, and weapons. Movement is typically two-dimensional with attacks hitting groups of enemies.

_Example:_ **Streets of Rage 4**, **Double Dragon**.

## Bullet Hell Games  
A subgenre of shoot ’em ups, bullet hell games are filled with intricate patterns of enemy projectiles. Players must dodge while returning fire, often with a small hitbox.

_Example:_ **Ikaruga**, **Touhou Project**.

## Card Games (Digital Card Battlers)  
Digital card games simulate collectible card gameplay, focusing on deck-building, strategy, and resource management.

_Example:_ **Hearthstone**, **Slay the Spire**.

## Fighting Games  
Close-quarters combat between two fighters on a single plane. Includes combos, special moves, blocking, and countering.

_Example:_ **Street Fighter II**, **Mortal Kombat**.

## Hack and Slash Games  
Action-heavy melee combat using weapons, often overlapping with beat ’em ups.

_Example:_ **Golden Axe**, **Diablo**.

## Idle Games (Hyper-Casual)  
Games where progress happens automatically with minimal interaction, often featuring incremental growth and prestige loops.

_Example:_ **Cookie Clicker**, **AdVenture Capitalist**.

## Metroidvania Games  
Non-linear exploration games with ability-gated progression and interconnected maps.

_Example:_ **Super Metroid**, **Hollow Knight**.

## Multiplayer Games (2D)  
Encompasses cooperative, competitive, party, and online multiplayer formats in 2D settings.

_Example:_ **Among Us**, **Bishi-Bashi Special**, **Contra**.

## Platform Games (Platformers)  
Games centered around jumping between platforms and avoiding hazards. Includes side-scrolling, vertical, puzzle-platformers, run-and-gun, and endless runners.

_Example:_ **Celeste**, **Sonic the Hedgehog**.

## Puzzle Games  
Logic, pattern, and problem-solving challenges in formats like tile-matching, physics puzzles, hidden objects, and escape rooms.

_Example:_ **Tetris**, **Baba Is You**.

## Rhythm Games  
Music-driven games where inputs are timed to beats and patterns.

_Example:_ **Dance Dance Revolution**, **Osu!**.

## Roguelike Games  
Procedurally generated, permadeath dungeon crawlers with turn-based gameplay.

_Example:_ **NetHack**, **Spelunky**.

## Role-Playing Games (RPGs)  
Character or party progression, quests, and story-driven exploration. Includes turn-based JRPGs, action RPGs, and tactical RPGs.

_Example:_ **Pokémon Red/Blue**, **Undertale**.

## Tower Defense Games  
Players defend against enemy waves using static towers with varied abilities and upgrade paths.

_Example:_ **Plants vs. Zombies**, **Bloons TD**.

## Turn-Based Strategy Games  
Players take turns controlling units and resources, focusing on planning and positioning.

_Example:_ **Advance Wars**, **Civilization II**.

## Visual Novel Games  
Interactive stories with branching paths, multiple endings, and minimal gameplay beyond choices.

_Example:_ **Clannad**, **Doki Doki Literature Club**.
